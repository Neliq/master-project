# Activity Messages [urgency]

This card is an application-oriented presentation of the unchanged ontology.
It does not add labels, counterexamples, thresholds, or definitions.

## Card-level rule

Evaluate each condition independently. A condition is TRUE only when all
required atoms are directly supported. It is FALSE only with direct
counterevidence. Otherwise it is UNKNOWN. A pattern needs one complete
TRUE trigger condition; a counterevidence condition cannot create a trigger.

## Condition 1: 1. Asynchronous Event Fabrication

Original formula (verbatim): `M_{\mathrm{displayed}}(t) \neq \emptyset \quad \land \quad M_{\mathrm{displayed}}(t) \notin E_{\mathrm{real}}(t)`
Operational reading: **Strict observable evaluation of the original predicate**
Polarity: `trigger`

### Required atoms
- Every atomic clause in the original formula is identified and evaluated in the stated scope.

### Mark UNKNOWN when
- Any referenced variable, threshold, comparator, transition, or set is not directly available.

### Direct counterevidence
- A directly observed atom contradicts a mandatory requirement.

### Do not infer
- Treat every atomic requirement in the formula as mandatory; preserve AND/OR grouping.
- Do not infer backend truth, future behavior, psychological effect, or causal intent from a static cue.

## Condition 2: 2. Cognitive Interruption

Original formula (verbatim): `\mathrm{Salience}(N_{\mathrm{activity}}) \to \mathrm{Max} \quad \land \quad \lambda_{\mathrm{interrupt}} > \tau_{\mathrm{cognitive\_load}} \implies S_{\mathrm{focus}} \to \mathrm{Disrupted}`
Operational reading: **Strict observable evaluation of the original predicate**
Polarity: `trigger`

### Required atoms
- Every atomic clause in the original formula is identified and evaluated in the stated scope.

### Mark UNKNOWN when
- Any referenced variable, threshold, comparator, transition, or set is not directly available.

### Direct counterevidence
- A directly observed atom contradicts a mandatory requirement.

### Do not infer
- Treat every premise and stated consequence as a required observed atom; do not evaluate the implication materially or vacuously.
- Do not infer backend truth, future behavior, psychological effect, or causal intent from a static cue.

## Condition 3: 3. Semantic Specificity of Activity-Notification Content

Original formula (verbatim): `\mathrm{Specificity}(T_{\mathrm{activity}}) < \tau_{\mathrm{specificity}} \quad \land \quad \neg\exists \text{IdentityRef} \in T_{\mathrm{activity}}`
Operational reading: **Strict observable evaluation of the original predicate**
Polarity: `trigger`

### Required atoms
- Every atomic clause in the original formula is identified and evaluated in the stated scope.

### Mark UNKNOWN when
- Any referenced variable, threshold, comparator, transition, or set is not directly available.

### Direct counterevidence
- A directly observed atom contradicts a mandatory requirement.

### Do not infer
- Treat every atomic requirement in the formula as mandatory; preserve AND/OR grouping.
- Do not infer backend truth, future behavior, psychological effect, or causal intent from a static cue.
