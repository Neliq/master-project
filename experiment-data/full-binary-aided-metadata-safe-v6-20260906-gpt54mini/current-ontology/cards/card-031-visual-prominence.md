# Visual Prominence [misdirection]

This card is an application-oriented presentation of the unchanged ontology.
It does not add labels, counterexamples, thresholds, or definitions.

## Card-level rule

Evaluate each condition independently. A condition is TRUE only when all
required atoms are directly supported. It is FALSE only with direct
counterevidence. Otherwise it is UNKNOWN. A pattern needs one complete
TRUE trigger condition; a counterevidence condition cannot create a trigger.

Domain/context gate: At least one pattern-specific object/context and one mechanism anchor must be directly observed. If the core context is contradicted, mark this card NO_MATCH rather than UNKNOWN.

## Condition 1: 1. Structural Asymmetry in DOM Subtree Weight

Original formula (verbatim): `\frac{|\mathrm{Desc}(N_{\mathrm{favorable}})|}{\mathrm{median}_{s \in \mathrm{Siblings}(N_{\mathrm{favorable}})} |\mathrm{Desc}(s)|} > \tau_{\mathrm{subtree\_bloat}}`
Operational reading: **Evaluate the source formula over directly observed evidence; preserve every Boolean operator, quantifier, comparison, unit, scope, and threshold.**
Polarity: `trigger`
Comparison policy: Use the original formula's explicit threshold or equality; do not invent values.
Review policy: TRUE requires a complete observed proof; FALSE requires a false atom or direct counterevidence; UNKNOWN is retained when a required atom, threshold, scope, or observation is unavailable. Do not recode UNKNOWN as BENIGN without a declared mapping.

### Required atoms
- Every atomic clause in the original formula is identified and evaluated in the stated scope.

### Mark UNKNOWN when
- Any referenced variable, threshold, comparator, transition, or set is not directly available.

### Direct counterevidence
- A directly observed atom contradicts a mandatory requirement.

### Do not infer
- Treat every atomic requirement in the formula as mandatory; preserve AND/OR grouping.
- Do not infer backend truth, future behavior, psychological effect, or causal intent from a static cue.

## Condition 2: 2. Absolute Bounding Box Dominance

Original formula (verbatim): `\frac{A(N_{\mathrm{favorable}})}{A(E_{\mathrm{baseline}})} > \tau_{\mathrm{area}}`
Operational reading: **Evaluate the source formula over directly observed evidence; preserve every Boolean operator, quantifier, comparison, unit, scope, and threshold.**
Polarity: `trigger`
Comparison policy: Use the original formula's explicit threshold or equality; do not invent values.
Review policy: TRUE requires a complete observed proof; FALSE requires a false atom or direct counterevidence; UNKNOWN is retained when a required atom, threshold, scope, or observation is unavailable. Do not recode UNKNOWN as BENIGN without a declared mapping.

### Required atoms

### Mark UNKNOWN when
- Any referenced variable, threshold, comparator, transition, or set is not directly available.

### Direct counterevidence

### Do not infer
- Treat every atomic requirement in the formula as mandatory; preserve AND/OR grouping.
- Do not infer backend truth, future behavior, psychological effect, or causal intent from a static cue.

## Condition 3: 3. Semantic Emphasis of Dominant Action Labels

Original formula (verbatim): `|\mathrm{Sent}(L(N_{\mathrm{favorable}}))| > 0.5 \quad \lor \quad L(N_{\mathrm{favorable}}) \cap D_{\mathrm{coercion}} \neq \emptyset`
Operational reading: **Evaluate the source formula over directly observed evidence; preserve every Boolean operator, quantifier, comparison, unit, scope, and threshold.**

Comparison policy: Use the original formula's explicit threshold or equality; do not invent values.
Review policy: TRUE requires a complete observed proof; FALSE requires a false atom or direct counterevidence; UNKNOWN is retained when a required atom, threshold, scope, or observation is unavailable. Do not recode UNKNOWN as BENIGN without a declared mapping.
