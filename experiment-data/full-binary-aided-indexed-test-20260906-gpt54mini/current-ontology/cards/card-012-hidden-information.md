# Hidden Information [sneaking]

This card is an application-oriented presentation of the unchanged ontology.
It does not add labels, counterexamples, thresholds, or definitions.

## Card-level rule

Evaluate each condition independently. A condition is TRUE only when all
required atoms are directly supported. It is FALSE only with direct
counterevidence. Otherwise it is UNKNOWN. A pattern needs one complete
TRUE trigger condition; a counterevidence condition cannot create a trigger.

Domain/context gate: At least one pattern-specific object/context and one mechanism anchor must be directly observed. If the core context is contradicted, mark this card NO_MATCH rather than UNKNOWN.

## Condition 1: 1. Structural Burial in High-Density Text

Original formula (verbatim): `|W(N_{\mathrm{document}})| > \tau_{\mathrm{fatigue}} \quad \land \quad P(t_{\mathrm{clause}}) = \mathrm{False}`
Operational reading: **Evaluate the source formula over directly observed evidence; preserve every Boolean operator, quantifier, comparison, unit, scope, and threshold.**
Polarity: `trigger`
Comparison policy: Use the original formula's explicit threshold or equality; do not invent values.
Review policy: TRUE requires a complete observed proof; FALSE requires a false atom or direct counterevidence; UNKNOWN is retained when a required atom, threshold, scope, or observation is unavailable. Do not recode UNKNOWN as BENIGN without a declared mapping.

### Required atoms
- Every atomic clause in the original formula is identified and evaluated in the stated scope.

### Mark UNKNOWN when
- Any referenced variable, threshold, comparator, transition, or set is not directly available.

### Direct counterevidence
- A directly observed atom contradicts a mandatory requirement.

### Do not infer
- Treat every atomic requirement in the formula as mandatory; preserve AND/OR grouping.
- Do not infer backend truth, future behavior, psychological effect, or causal intent from a static cue.

## Condition 2: 2. Typographical and Chromatic Camouflage

Original formula (verbatim): `S_{\mathrm{font}}(N_{\mathrm{critical}}) < \tau_{\mathrm{min\_readable}} \quad \lor \quad \mathrm{CR}(N_{\mathrm{critical}}, L_{\mathrm{bg}}) < \tau_{\mathrm{wcag\_min}}`
Operational reading: **Evaluate the source formula over directly observed evidence; preserve every Boolean operator, quantifier, comparison, unit, scope, and threshold.**
Polarity: `trigger`
Comparison policy: Use the original formula's explicit threshold or equality; do not invent values.
Review policy: TRUE requires a complete observed proof; FALSE requires a false atom or direct counterevidence; UNKNOWN is retained when a required atom, threshold, scope, or observation is unavailable. Do not recode UNKNOWN as BENIGN without a declared mapping.

## Condition 3: 3. Semantic Concealment of Adverse Terms

Original formula (verbatim): `K_{\mathrm{adverse}} \cap T_{\mathrm{DOM}} \neq \emptyset \quad \land \quad \mathrm{IsConcealed}(N_{\mathrm{adverse}}) = \mathrm{True}`
Operational reading: **Evaluate the source formula over directly observed evidence; preserve every Boolean operator, quantifier, comparison, unit, scope, and threshold.**
