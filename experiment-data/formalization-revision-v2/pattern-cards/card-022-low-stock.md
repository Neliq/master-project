# Low Stock [urgency]

This card is an application-oriented presentation of the unchanged ontology.
It does not add labels, counterexamples, thresholds, or definitions.

This v2 card reviews a provisional evidence-only judgment. Missing formal evidence
does not overturn that judgment. A complete proof may upgrade; direct contradiction
may downgrade.

## Card-level rule

Evaluate each condition independently. A condition is TRUE only when all
required atoms are directly supported. It is FALSE only with direct
counterevidence. Otherwise it is UNKNOWN. A pattern needs one complete
TRUE trigger condition; a counterevidence condition cannot create a trigger.

## Condition 1: 1. Inventory Fabrication

Original formula (verbatim): `I_{\mathrm{displayed}}(x) \le \tau_{\mathrm{scarcity}} \quad \text{given} \quad I_{\mathrm{displayed}}(x) \ll I_{\mathrm{true}}(x)`
Operational reading: **Strict observable evaluation of the original predicate**
Polarity: `trigger`

### Required atoms
- Every atomic clause in the original formula is identified and evaluated in the stated scope.

### Mark UNKNOWN when
- Any referenced variable, threshold, comparator, transition, or set is not directly available.

### Direct counterevidence
- A directly observed atom contradicts a mandatory requirement.

### Do not infer
- Treat every atomic requirement in the formula as mandatory; preserve AND/OR grouping.
- Do not infer backend truth, future behavior, psychological effect, or causal intent from a static cue.

## Condition 2: 2. Visual Alarm Salience of Scarcity Indicators

Original formula (verbatim): `\mathrm{Hue}(N_{\mathrm{stock}}) \in [0^\circ, 30^\circ] \quad \land \quad \Delta\mathrm{Stock}_{\mathrm{actual}} = 0`
Operational reading: **Strict observable evaluation of the original predicate**
Polarity: `trigger`

### Required atoms
- Every atomic clause in the original formula is identified and evaluated in the stated scope.

### Mark UNKNOWN when
- Any referenced variable, threshold, comparator, transition, or set is not directly available.

### Direct counterevidence
- A directly observed atom contradicts a mandatory requirement.

### Do not infer
- Treat every atomic requirement in the formula as mandatory; preserve AND/OR grouping.
- Do not infer backend truth, future behavior, psychological effect, or causal intent from a static cue.

## Condition 3: 3. Semantic Verifiability of Stock-Level Quantifiers

Original formula (verbatim): `\exists t_1, t_2 : |t_2 - t_1| < 60\text{s} \quad \land \quad Q_{\mathrm{stock}}(t_1) \neq Q_{\mathrm{stock}}(t_2) \quad \land \quad \neg\mathrm{HasTransaction}(t_1, t_2)`
Operational reading: **Strict observable evaluation of the original predicate**
Polarity: `trigger`

### Required atoms
- Every atomic clause in the original formula is identified and evaluated in the stated scope.

### Mark UNKNOWN when
- Any referenced variable, threshold, comparator, transition, or set is not directly available.

### Direct counterevidence
- A directly observed atom contradicts a mandatory requirement.

### Do not infer
- Treat every atomic requirement in the formula as mandatory; preserve AND/OR grouping.
- Do not infer backend truth, future behavior, psychological effect, or causal intent from a static cue.
